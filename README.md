# Advent of Code 2023 – Python Solutions

This repository contains my Python solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event that offers a new set of programming puzzles each day in December leading up to Christmas.

## Repository Structure

Each day’s puzzle is located in its respective directory (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.). Inside each directory, you’ll find:
- **Solution script** (`main.py`): Python code that solves the day's puzzle.
- **Input file** (e.g., `input.txt`): The input data provided for the puzzle (if applicable).
- **Explanation** (optional): Some solutions may include comments or a brief explanation of the approach used.

## Getting Started

To set up the environment and run any solution, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   This project includes a `pyproject.toml` file for managing dependencies and project settings. You can use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install

2. **Running Solutions**:
    After setting up the environment, navigate to the respective day's directory and execute the Python script. For example:

    ```bash
    poetry run python day01/main.py

## Requirements

These solutions use basic Python libraries compatible with **Python 3.13** or higher. No additional dependencies are needed beyond those specified in `pyproject.toml`.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my personal take on the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles and may not be the most optimized or only solutions. Feel free to explore and modify them as you work through the challenges yourself!
